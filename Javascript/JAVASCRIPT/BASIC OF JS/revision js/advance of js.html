        // closser function in js
        //In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
        // Here's what that means in simpler terms:
        // Imagine you have a function inside another function.
        //The inner function has access to the variables and parameters of the outer function, 
        // even after the outer function has finished executing. This is possible because the 
        // inner function maintains a reference to the environment in which it was created. 
        // This combination of the function and the references to its surrounding state 
        // (the variables, parameters, etc.) is what we call a closure.


        function outerFunction() {
        let outerVariable = 'I am from outer function';
    
        function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
        }

        return innerFunction; // Return the inner function
        }   

        let closureFunction = outerFunction(); // outerFunction has finished executing, but closureFunction still remembers outerVariable

        closureFunction(); // This will log 'I am from outer function'
        // example 1



        var sum = function(a){
            console.log("my salary " + " $" + a);
            var c = 10;
            return function(b){
                return a + b + c;
            }
        };

        var store = sum(200);
        console.log(store(10));


        // example 2

        var sum2 = function(a , b ,c ){
            return {
                getdata1: function(){
                    return a + b
                },
                getdata2: function(){
                    return a + b + c
                }
            }
