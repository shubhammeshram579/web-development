              <p className="card-text text-dark">
              Every rescue story shines brighter during the holiday season, a time for hope, love, and second chances — and Claire’s journey is no exception. This brave 2-year-old Chihuahua mix, along with her four young puppies, embodies the spirit of the season. Saved from the brink of tragedy, Claire and her pups were given the gift of life through the compassionate collaboration of our shelter partner, Friends of Jefferson Animals, and the unwavering dedication of our Mobile Rescue Team.

              Whatever you celebrate this month — Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, or Winter Solstice — December is pure magic. The lights on the trees, the light from the stars, and the candlelight — it all feels precious during the darkest month of the year. Memories feel precious, too, especially the memories of all my sweet 2024 fosters. I wish I could list each one, but believe me, they’re all in my heart. Here are just a few of the bright little lights from 2024.

              <p className="card-text text-dark">
              When it comes to adopting a pet, people often envision a bouncy puppy or playful kitten, but senior pets have an incredible amount to offer. Adopting an older dog or cat can be an incredibly rewarding choice for both the animal and the adopter.

              When I saw this picture of Mango, I imagined him patiently waiting for that phone to ring with the best news possible: a new family to love him, a new lap to snuggle on, and a fresh start for his golden years. Mango’s story and his tender amber eyes spoke to me. A senior kitty whose life has seen too many dramatic twists and turns, Mango could be the poster boy for senior pet adoption. And since November is Adopt a Senior Pet Month, here is his saga.
