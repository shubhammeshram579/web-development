        <p>It all started when our founder Rob Caslick and two mates wheeled up a BBQ to Kings Cross to cook the very best, wholesome food for those living rough. Their ’anything but snags’ proposition stood out and it wasn’t long before they garnered a loyal following. ‘How can we scale from here?’, they thought. That’s when the Buy 1, Give 1’ model came into play. Rob took a jar around the corner to see if a local domestic violence refuge would like some lunches too and it grew organically from there. 

            We have since collaborated with some of the country’s best chefs to deliver the best meals we can, to domestic violence shelters and people in need. It didn’t take long for our ‘Buy 1, Give 1’ idea to extend to luxury gift packs and self care essentials, designed to spark a sense of self-worth at a time of intense vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Social employment, however, is where we create the greatest impact. Through our flagship ‘Work Work’ employment pathways programs, we hire the women from the shelters we serve, empowering them to re-establish their self-belief and independence, while bridging the ‘love and skills’ gap in their journey to re-entering the workforce after living in crisis.

            Basically, we’re the people who just want to do some good. And we reckon you’re one of those people, too.</p>
